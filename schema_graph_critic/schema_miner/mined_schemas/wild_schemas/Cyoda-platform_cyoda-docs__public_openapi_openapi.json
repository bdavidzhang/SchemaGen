    "description": "API for Cyoda, providing access to entity management, search capabilities, SQL schema operations, and more.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n### Entity Management\nAPIs for managing entities including creation, updates, and statistics retrieval.\nAll changes are executed transactionally with collections processed in transactional batches.\n\n### Entity Model\nOperations for managing entity models, including import/export, versioning, and lifecycle management.\nSupports model locking/unlocking, change level control, and metadata conversion through various formats.\n\nModel Lifecycle Rules:\n- Entity models must be locked before any entities can be saved using that model\n- A locked model cannot be unlocked if there are existing entities in the database using that model\n- Models can only be deleted when unlocked and when no entities reference them\n\nChange Level Control:\nModels support hierarchical change levels (from least to most impactful):\n- ARRAY_LENGTH: Only allows UniTypeArray width increases\n- ARRAY_ELEMENTS: Permits MultiTypeArray changes without new types\n- TYPE: Allows type modifications\n- STRUCTURAL: Permits fundamental model changes\n\nWhen a change level is set, all less impactful changes are automatically allowed.\n\n### Search\nProvides endpoints for searching and retrieving entities using both synchronous and asynchronous approaches.\n\nKey Features:\n- Snapshot-based searches for large datasets\n- Real-time synchronous searches for immediate results\n- Point-in-time querying capabilities\n- Pagination support for large result sets\n\nSearch Methods:\n1. Snapshot Search (/snapshot/*):\n   - Creates a persistent snapshot of search results\n   - The query is distributed across the cluster of Cyoda processing nodes\n   - Horizontally scalable - query time decreases linearly with cluster size\n   - Supports asynchronous processing of large datasets\n   - Allows status monitoring and cancellation\n   - Results can be retrieved in pages\n   \n2. Direct Search (/{entityName}/{modelVersion}):\n   - Synchronous, in-memory search\n   - Designed for small to medium datasets\n   - Limited by maximum result set size (default: 1000, max: 10000)\n   - Non-distributed (executes on single node)\n   - Configurable timeout and result limits\n   - Returns immediate streaming results\n\nAll endpoints support:\n- Point-in-time queries using ISO 8601 datetime format\n- Complex search conditions using GroupConditionDto\n- Model-specific searches by entity name and version\n\n### SQL Schema\nOperations for managing SQL schemas and tables, including generation from entity models\nand configuration of database views.\n\n### Edge Messaging\nAPIs for handling edge message communication and processing.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThis API uses **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant** for machine-to-machine authentication.\n\n### Getting Started\n1. **Create a machine-to-machine (M2M) user** through the client management API (requires SUPER_USER role)\n2. **Obtain an access token** using the client credentials via the OAuth token endpoint\n3. **Authenticate requests** by including the access token in the Authorization header: `Bearer <access_token>`\n\n### Authentication Flow\n- **Technical User Management**: Create, list, reset credentials, and delete M2M clients for your organization\n- **Token Issuance**: Standard OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow - no prior authentication required\n- **Bearer Token Authentication**: All protected API endpoints require a valid JWT bearer token\n- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different endpoints require specific roles (USER, ADMIN, M2M, SUPER_USER)\n\n### User Account Management\n- **Account Information**: Retrieve current user account details, tenant information, and roles\n- **Subscription Management**: Access subscription information, limits, and feature toggles\n- **Multi-tenant Support**: All operations are scoped to the authenticated user's legal entity, a.k.a tenant\n\n### Security Features\n- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication with configurable expiration\n- **Role-based Authorization**: Access control based on user roles\n- **Tenant Isolation**: Data and operations are isolated by legal entity boundaries\n- **Credential Management**: Secure client secret generation and rotation capabilities",
